# Interruption Handling System for Conversational Robots

## Introduction
This repository accompanies the paper **"Interruption Handling for Conversational Robots"**. It contains the source code for an example of our interruption handling system integrated into an
LLM-powered social robot built on the Platform for Situated Intelligence (\psi). We prompt engineered a large language model (GPT-4o-2024-05-13) to generate contextualized robot speech and select fitting facial expressions, head movements, and task actions for a timed decision-making (dessert survival simulation), a contentious discussion (whether the federal government should abolish capital punishment), and a question and answer task (space exploration themed). For more details on the interruption handling system, please refer to our [manuscript](). For more detailed description of the robot implementation, see the [supplemental materials](https://intuitivecomputing.github.io/publications/2024-interruption-cao-supp.pdf).

## Modifying System
We welcome development on the error-aware robotic system software to extend its error management capabilities and its applicability to different robots and different social signals.

For questions that are not covered in this README, we welcome developers to open an issue or contact the author at [shiyecao@cs.jhu.edu](mailto:shiyecao@cs.jhu.edu).
